Context managers are a lot of fun and come in handy all the time. I use them in my automated tests
all the time for opening and closing dialogs, for example. Now you should be able to use some of
Pythonâ€™s built-in tools to create your own context managers. Be sure to take the time to read the
Python documentation on contextlib as there are lots of additional information that is not covered
in this chapter. Have fun and happy coding!
