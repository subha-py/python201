# The primary reason to use compile is to save it to be reused later on in your
# code. However, compile also takes some flags that can used to enable various special features. We
# will take a look at that next.
# Special Note: When you compile patterns, they will get automatically cached so if you arenâ€™t using lot
# of regular expressions in your code, then you may not need to save the compiled object to a variable.
